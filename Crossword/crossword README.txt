This is a crossword made by me and Parker Gowans.

This game starts with a trivia question about the definitions of many Python terms.

The player can earn at most 20 points a question for a total of 200 possible points.

If the player guesses incorrectly the possible points earned will go down by about half until they fail more than once, in which they're stuck with the lowest point value of the question.

If the player guesses correctly the point value of that question is added to their total to be displayed at the end of the game.

When the player guesses correctly a word search puzzle appears and the player is tasked with finding the word they just defined. No points get deduced for wrong answers on the word search, but attempts are still logged.

The game continues in a loop with a new word and definition ten times before the cycle breaks, the total score is displayed, the number of attempts are visible and the cycle closes.
