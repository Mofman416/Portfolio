This is the BlackJack program we made in class.

The user inputs how many players there are and what their name is.

The game then deals two cards to everyone, with the dealer's second card hidden.

The game gives people the option to either hit or pass. If their deck value is over 21, they bust.

The game keeps track of players that are remaining in the game and who wins.
